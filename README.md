# Containers
*"The multiple available containers in C++ all have very different usage. To make sure you understand them, letâ€™s re-implement them!"*

## About

The objective of this project is to implement the various container types of the C++ standard template library.
- **vector** : same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted.
- **map** : an associative container/array that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value
- **stack** : a type of container adaptor based on a LIFO(Last In First Out) system, where a new element added at one end (top) can be removed from that end only.
